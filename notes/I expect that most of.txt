I expect that most of the images uploaded to my site will be taken via cell phone.
I should normalize my images to the size and resolution of the average cell phone camera.
I'm going to need to Google.
Strategy:

What is the most common cell phone in current usage?
Second most common?
Third most common?
Fourth most common?
What are the resolutions of their back cameras?
Take those numbers and calculate an estimated average cell phone back camera resolution.
-- Most likely you will have to round up the nearest power of 2.
